See [README.md](./extension/README.md) for the readme of the extension.

You can get the extension in the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.debug-visualizer).

## Who/What is this extension for

- **Educators** - You can easily visualize the code which makes some difficult concepts easier to understand for your students.
- **Self-teaching** - Help yourself understand and debug code
- **Research**
- **Presentation**
- **Anyone who likes fun graphs** - Seriously, who doesn't!

## What is this extension not for

- **Professional use** - The extension works by personalizing your code to fit the extension's requirements.

  So, that means, you might have variables that their purpose is only to be consumed by this extension, which might not be what most people might want, unless you want to go that path. :)

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for build instructions and implementation details.
